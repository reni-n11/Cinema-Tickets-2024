# Cinema-Tickets-2024
A simple C# Windows Forms program in Bulgarian I created in university for choosing tickets for a movie at a cinema with pre-taken seats.

# Features
1. Choosing tickets:
   The user is able to select the amount of different types of tickets through the drop-down menus. If the user selects then deselects the amount of tickets, a message is shown, telling the user to select tickets. When done, the user clicks on the "next" button and proceeds to choosing the seats.
2. Choosing seats:
   A map of the screening room for the movie is displayed with available and taken seats shown. The user can select and deselect available seats. Above the map is a helpful text, telling the user how many seats need to be selected to be equal to the amount of tickets chosen and if that number is met. Once it is met, the user can proceed to completing the order by clicking on the "next" button. The user can go back at any time by clicking on the "back" button or using the tab control at the top.
3. Completing the order:
   Information about the type and amount of selected tickets is shown, as well as the seats chosen. If the user is satisfied with the choice, they may click on the "complete order" button. Upon clicking the button, a message box shows up, stating that the order has been successfully placed.
